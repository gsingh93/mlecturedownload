# MLecture Download

The University of Michigan used to use a lecture recording site that didn't let you download lectures. In most sites (and in the new, updated site), you can simply right click on the video, inspect the element, and find the URL for the video. For the old site, this wasn't so easy. I spent a good amount of time poking through the source code of the website, and I was finally able to track down where the video was actually located. I created this site so you could enter in the URL of the lecture and it would generate a downoad link for the video.

Since the lecture recording site has been updated, this site is no longer necessary.
